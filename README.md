# Math Master

**Math Master** is a dynamic quiz game designed to test and improve mathematical problem-solving skills through randomized arithmetic challenges. Developed in Java using NetBeans, this application serves as a practical demonstration of data structures and algorithms in action.

## Project Overview

Math Master emphasizes backend logic and data structure manipulation over graphical design. It features:

- **Multiple-choice arithmetic questions**
- **Instant feedback after each question**
- **Final score display with answer summary**
- **Past game records**

Designed as a **final requirement for the Data Structures and Algorithms course**, this project showcases the application of core computer science principles through an interactive quiz format.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **NetBeans (Java SE)**: Primary development environment and GUI designer.

## Key Features

- **Circular Linked List**: Used to cycle through a randomized list of quiz questions.
- **Queue**: Stores the scores of recent game sessions.
- **Sorting and Searching Algorithms**: Enables efficient viewing and filtering of past scores.
- **Answer Summary**: Displays correct and incorrect answers after each quiz session.

## Current Limitations

- **No Database Integration**: All data is stored in memory and lost upon program termination.
- **No Persistent User Tracking**: Game results are only available during a single runtime session.

## Future Improvements

- Integrate a **database** to persist game records and user progress.
- Add **difficulty levels** and question categories.
- Implement **user accounts** and scoring leaderboards.

## Expected Outcomes

This project offers students a hands-on experience in applying data structures to build functional applications. Math Master encourages logical thinking, data manipulation, and Java GUI development in a single educational package.
