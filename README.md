**Math Master: A Dynamic Math Quiz Game**  

Math Master is an interactive quiz game designed to test and enhance mathematical skills through a randomized set of five math questions. Each question presents four multiple-choice answers, challenging players to think quickly and accurately. At the end of the quiz, the system displays the **final score, a summary of the player's answers**, and a record of recent game results.  

Developed as a **final requirement for our Data Structures and Algorithms course**, this project implements:  
- **Circular Linked Lists** for managing and cycling through questions.  
- **Queues** to store recent game records.  
- **Sorting and Searching Algorithms** to organize and retrieve past scores efficiently.  

Currently, **this project does not include a database**, meaning all records are stored in memory during runtime. Future improvements could involve database integration for persistent data storage, user tracking, and advanced analytics.
